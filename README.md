# Discord-Bot
Playing around with discord.py on my personal server.

This is a discord bot that I've been working on for one of the Discord servers that I own. It's original development was an inside joke, but I used it to mess around with 
discord.py. It is able to:

keep a list of quotes and add, subtract, print, or recall them;

check for several specific messages and send a response according to which message was sent, or who sent it;

or roast a specific user whenever they send a message(hopefully a command in the near future).
